# Meta-analysis for CRC data

## 1. Prepare analysis data

Execute `Prepare_data.R` for setup.

## 2. Analyze original data

Execute `Analysis_org_data.R` to analyze original data by `Melody` and other compared methods.

## 3. Analyze batch-corrected data

Execute `Analysis_bat_data.R` to analyze batch-corrected data by `Melody` and other compared methods.

## 4. `Melody` sensitivity analysis

Execute `Sensitivity.R` to analyze sensitivity of `Melody` by using different reference taxa.

## 5. Stability analysis

Execute `Stability.R` to analyze the stability of `Melody` and other compared methods. 

## 6. Prediction on CRC data

Execute `Prediction.R` to compare prediction powers between `Melody` and other compared methods.
